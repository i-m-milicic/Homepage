The gel was made from a mixture                              of clay, lime, and water. A 1-D mathematical model based on the continuum me-                              chanics, for predicting the thermal conductivity, is proposed. The results obtained                              by applying the proposed mathematical model were compared with the measure-                              ment data of experimental tests, using the Isomet 2114 instrument. The program                              envisages the measurement of thermal conductivity of three specimens, 5-year-old,                              comprising three series within 365 days. In the theoretical analysis, the same pa-                              rameters of thermal stability were treated as in the experiment. The average value                              of the material thermal conductivity is 0.0990 W/mK, so it can be concluded that,                              the composite material intended for the envelope of the proposed constructive sys-                              tem “Ethno-eco-passive house” is verified as thermally suitable.                              Key words: thermal analysis, thermal conductivity, composite plate                       Introductory remarks                              In order to use the new material for building Ethno-eco-passive houses [1], it is nec-                      essary to check thermal properties. The reason for this is that the thermal stability of the basic                      and complementary elements of constructive systems is an important parameter in determining                      the category of energy efficiency of the structure [2-5]. In thermal analysis for determining the                      thermal conductivity of materials, depending on whether the temperature distribution within the                      specimen is time-dependent or not, two groups of methods are used: static and dynamic.                              Static methods, i. e. methods of stable thermal conductivity conditions are obtained                      by using the Fourier’s law for conducting heat by measuring the temperature gradient, gradT,                      and the heat flux, q.                              In the case of a cylindrical form of a sample the dominant passage of thermal energy                      is in the axial direction with isothermal plane that are perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder.                      So, this is the basis of the physical model of linear heat energy implementation. On the other                      hand, due to the losses of heat caused by passing through the material it cannot be considered                      that the temperature gradient is always directed perpendicular to the isothermal plane. It is then                      necessary to pay a particular attention to the measurement of the temperature gradient value.                         * Corresponding author, e-mail: milicic@gf.uns.ac.rs","Miličić, I. M., et al.: Model for the Analysis of Thermal Conductivity of Composite Material ...                      3514                             THERMAL SCIENCE: Year 2019, Vol. 23, No. 6A, pp. 3513-3523                               Dynamic methods, i. e. the methods of unstable states treat the distribution of the                      specimen temperature as a variable size in time, whereby the application of the differential 3-D                      equation of heat propagation is necessary. If the test time is short, then the heat loss has less                      influence on the measurement results. Dynamic methods can be divided into two categories:                      transient – if the amount of heat is transferred to a sample with one function treated as a con-                      stant source, or periodic – with modulation of a certain period. Consequently, the temperature                      changes in the treated material specimen will be either transient or periodic. When the thermal                      conductivity of building materials of weak thermal insulation properties is tested, the applica-                      tion of stable state methods requires more time to achieve the thermal equilibrium. Therefore,                      the dynamic method of measurement is faster and more convenient. The most commonly used                      is the so–called thermal conductivity probe with linear heat source [6]. The treated mathemati-                      cal 3-D model is based on the theoretical foundations of the Continuum Mechanics, for predict-                      ing the thermal conductivity, similar to [7-16].                              In this paper, the thermal theoretical experimental analysis was carried out on the ba-                      sis of which a model for estimating the thermal conductivity was formulated. In order to verify                      the accuracy of the model, an experimental analysis was performed on specimens collected                      from gel and straw. Gel is a mixture of clay, lime and water. The research was motivated by the                      need for examining the material for the construction of the building Ethno-eco-passive house,                      proposed by [1]. In the experiment realization, a non-standard method for testing the thermal                      conductivity was used. The results of the experiment confirmed the applicability of the tested                      building materials and were the basis for the validation of the proposed mathematical model for                      the prediction of thermal properties.

The panel obtained by the method                      of incorporating a composite in wooden moulds 60×120×10 cm, fig. 1(c), was realized in two                      independent phases.                              The first phase is the preparation of the gel, fig. 1(b), made up of a mixture of water,                      clay and slag lime prepared by mixing. The second phase is completely independent and rep-                      resents the grinding of dry straw on a sieve with openings of 5.0 mm in diameter.

Therefore, prepared straw fibres have, with volume ratio, the largest share in the new                      composite thermo insulating material. The next stage of the composite material preparation is                      mixing based on gel volume constraints (one mix design specified by the project) and the fibre                                                                                           3                      of the ground straw to achieve the density of the material of about ρ = 600 kg/m .

Solving the problem of heat                      spreading is based on the determination of:                         – the scalar temperature field – T(x, y, z, t),                           – vector field of intensity of heat flux (flow) –  q( , , , )x y zt .                           The final solution is obtained when a connection between                      these two values is established. The law on energy maintenance                      must be satisfied at every material point of the mechanical body,                      so that the equation of the energy thermal equilibrium of the unit   Figure 5.

However, the temperature, T, is the fundamental variable                      (primary size), while the heat flux, q, is dual size.

If the observed body consists of several different homogeneous isotropic materials,                      which is not the case of the material considered in this paper, the second-order tensor, Λ, is                      reduced to a scalar, λ, according to [7], which will be different for each material in the structure.

It is pointed out that this is characteristic for construction structures under normal                      service/operational conditions (not at high temperatures such as fire or explosions).                              On the other hand, starting from a differential equation that describes the Newton’s                      law of conducting heat (cooling), the change in the specimen temperature is proportional to                      the difference in specimen temperature and the environment. We consider the proportionality                      in this paper as a constant, k, and it is called the thermal conductivity, which is known to be                      different for all treated specimens of the material, so it can be written:                                                       dT                                                                   ) k T −                                                          =  (   T                                 (9)                                                       dt      l  d","Miličić, I.

Let us look at three cross section points of the temperature distribution functions                      T1z(t) and T1h(t), T2z(t), and T2h(t) and T3z(t), and T3h(t), according to the solution (11),                      figs. 6-8. Since the test time of the first specimen in all three series is the same, then the ordinate                      for t = 1.5 goes through all three points of the intersection of the solution (11) and thus verifies                                                                              o                      three experimental data, T mean  = 29.712  C, 29.654  C, and 29.619  C.                                                                 o                                                       o                              Accordingly, the solution (11) of the proposed 1-D model (9) based on the simulations                      for t = 1.5 hours successfully validates the experimentally registered quantities for the first                      specimen in all three batches during testing of t = 1.5 hours. On the other hand, by the proposed                      1-D model, for the known experimentally registered thermal conductivity of materials, it is                      possible to predict the same registered size for all three specimens in three series, at different                      experiment time t =1, 1.5, 2, and 12 hours.

Higher heat capacity of the material means that it can accumulate a higher amount of                      heat. Based on the numerical analysis carried out with the proposed 1-D mathematical model                      (9), it has been shown that higher density materials have a higher thermal capacity. This indi-                      cates the need for an adequate selection of the recipes, i. e. the share of individual components                      in the preparation of materials for building Ethno-eco-passive houses.
